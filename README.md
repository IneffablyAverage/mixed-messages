# Mixed Messages

## Purpose

this portfolio project is a program that outputs a unique message every time it is run.

## How To Use

simply load the HTML file in your web browser and click the "Show Me!" button to display the message

after that if you would like to load a new message, you can either reload the page or press the "play again" button that has now appeared

## How It Works

"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is the base sentance being used to assemble the unique messages 
within that sentance there are several word types that get swapped out:

- adjective1 "quick"
- adjective2 "brown"
- noun1 "fox"
- verb (past) "jumped"
- positiononal preposition "over"
- adjective3 "lazy"
- noun2 "dog"

within the js file you can find lists of adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc. that will be randomly selected to build the outbound message

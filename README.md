# Mixed Messages

## Purpose

this portfolio project is a program that outputs a unique message every time it is run.

## How To Use

simply load the HTML file in your web browser and click the "Show Me!" button to display the message

after that if you would like to load a new message, you can either reload the page or press the "play again" button that has now appeared

## How It Works



To run this program you must have an API Key from API-Ninjas.com 
Im not affiliated with them. They're just the first random word api I found.
once you have an API Key create a .env file in the root directory with the following format

    API_KEY={your api key}

replace {your api key} with your api key


boot the proxy server before running the html document.


"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is the base sentance being used to assemble the unique messages

# Mixed Messages

## Purpose

this portfolio project is a program that outputs a unique message every time it is run.

## How To Use

simply load the HTML file in your web browser and click the "Show Me!" button to display the message

after that if you would like to load a new message, you can either reload the page or press the "play again" button that has now appeared

## How It Works

"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is the base sentance being used to assemble the unique messages
